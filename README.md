This project is a basic clone of the Google app with the following features:

### Search functionality: 
Simulating Google search using Google autocomplete suggestions.
### Google Lens simulation: 
A simple feature to emulate Google Lens with predefined dataset.
### Voice Search: 
Implemented using a native module on Android.

# Features

### Search:
Users can enter a query in the search bar and view results using Google autocomplete suggestions.

### Google Lens:
Users can upload or select an image to simulate recognition and display results using predefined dataset.

### Voice Search (Android Only):
Voice search functionality is implemented using a native Android module.
Ensure microphone permissions are granted for this feature to work.

# Limitations
Voice Search and Google Lens are currently supported only on Android, as they rely on native modules. Google Lens search features are implemented using predefined dataset.

# Usage

### Search: 
Enter text in the search bar and can see autocomplete suggestions.

### Google Lens: 
Upload or select an image to view simulated recognition results.

### Voice Search (Android): 
Use the microphone button to speak your query and view search results.

# Notes
The app uses predefined dataset for Google Lens search functionalities.

The project is for educational purposes only and is not affiliated with Google


# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
